## Abstract

A Digital Art gallery where Artists can upload their Artwork and customers can buy their desired Artworks and Gallery owners can post their upcoming events in our platform. 
Art is the maneuver where humans demonstrate their own thought, viewpoint, concepts through creative and imaginative talent. It is the unique sector where
we get the opportunity to see how beguiling the human brain works. In this 21st century our world is surging with advanced technologies, it is high time we merge these two potential ingenious territories. In light of the increasing technological advancements, we have observed a steady surge in the replacement of human labor with automation and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, we have come to the realization that creativity is an irreplaceable aspect of human ingenuity. To safeguard this vital aspect of our culture and ensure that it receives the utmost priority along with technological progress, we have created a cutting-edge digital platform known as ”ART PATIO.”The platform offers a virtual exhibition hall where artists can showcase their unique and visionary creations to the world. Bangladesh is renowned for its rich and diverse culture, reflected in the many artistic forms present in our society. As the young custodians of our nation, it is our moral duty to promote these masterpieces and bring them to the attention of a global audience. ”Art Patio” provides a platform for artists who may not have had the opportunity to display their artwork on social media or other platforms, thereby giving them the recognition, they deserve. 
&nbsp;
Furthermore, ”Art Patio” is not just a mere showcase platform; it is a revo- lutionary e-commerce site where artists can financially benefit from selling their unique and exceptional creations. We firmly believe that this state-of-the-art digital platform will be a game-changer for the art community, and it will prove to be an invaluable resource for those who appreciate the inimitable aspect of human creativity.
